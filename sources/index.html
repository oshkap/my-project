        <strong>Asparagus</strong>, or garden asparagus, folk name sparrow
        grass, scientific name <em>Asparagus officinalis</em>, is a perennial
        flowering plant species in the genus Asparagus. Asparagus is rich in
        minerals and vitamins A, C and folic acid. It's a fibrous vegetable that
        may support a healthy gut, as well as help to lower blood pressure. For
        these reasons, it can be considered a healthy addition to any diet.
        <br />
        Including asparagus in your diet is a healthy choice, regardless of how
        you prepare it. Whether you cook it or eat it raw is a matter of
        personal preference. Both options add fiber, antioxidants, and essential
        nutrients to your diet. Asparagus is a nutritious and delicious
        vegetable that can be eaten every day. Low in calories and packed with
        essential vitamins, minerals, and antioxidants, it's great to include in
        a fiber-rich diet to keep your digestive system healthy. Specifically,
        when asparagus was cooked, the content of beta carotene and quercetin -
        two powerful antioxidants - increased by 24% and 98%, respectively.
        However, another study found that the antioxidant activity in cooked
        white asparagus was almost three times higher than in raw asparagus.
